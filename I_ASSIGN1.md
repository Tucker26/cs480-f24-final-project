# Individual Assignment 1 - Cloud Functions

In this exercise you will learn about Cloud Functions, also known as Functions as a Service (FaaS).

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> This exercise offers you two options for completion. One of the options - creating your own AWS or Azure account - **has the potential to incur charges** and **requires a valid credit or debit card** to sign up. There is no way around this - even if you sign up for a free trial and intend to never use more than the free tier's resources, you are still required to provide a credit card.
>
> Since I acknowledge and understand that you may be uncomfortable providing payment information, or you may not even have sufficient funds for the temporary hold, I offer an alternative method via AWS Educate that does not require a credit card. 
>
> The AWS Educate method involves the AWS Educate Lambda Fundamentals course, for which you can obtain a certificate URL that you can use as your assignment submission to indicate successful completion of the exercise. However, I do not want to restrict you to only using AWS - Azure's Cloud Functions service is equally useful to learn and understand, but like AWS, Azure requires payment information to create an account even for free usage.
>
> See the assignment for details, but be aware that you **do not** need to sign up with payment information if you feel uncomfortable doing so - it will not have any impact on your grade on this assignment or in this course.

There are two options you have for how to complete this exercise:

## Method 1 - Use Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Learn.

If you choose this method, you will need to sign up for an Azure account on Microsoft Azure. You may use your StarID login for this if you choose, or you may use a personal E-mail. **I strongly recommend using your StarID, as you will need to do so for the Microsoft Learn steps below - being logged into two Microsoft accounts can be quite confusing and may create issues.**

* [Sign up for a Microsoft Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account)

As noted above, you must provide a valid credit card to sign up for these services, and you may find a small temporary hold (typically $1 USD) placed on your card which will be reversed within a day or so. This is standard practice to verify the validity of credit cards. 

> *Tip:**
>
> An option for limiting cloud costs might be to use a card from a service such as <Privacy.com>. Such virtual cards can be configured with spending limits and can be manually deactivated at any time. You also do not need to provide your actual credit card to the service when using such a method.

Create a Microsoft Learn account profile. To do so, visit <https://learn.microsoft.com> and click the Sign In link in the top right corner. **Log in to your Star ID account - i.e. `<starid>@go.minnstate.edu`.**

Once signed in, complete all of the following tutorials:

* [Introduction to Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/intro-azure-functions/)
* [Create serverless logic with Azure functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-serverless-logic-with-azure-functions/)
* [Execute an Azure Function with Triggers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/execute-azure-function-with-triggers/)

After completing all three modules, collect your completion badge links. Visit <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/me/achievements?source=docs#badges-section> and you should see the list of badges for the courses you completed. For all three of the above courses, click the Share link (![assets/mslearn_sharelink.png](Share link icon)) and choose Copy Link. do this for all three tutorials. **These three completion badge links are your submission for this assignment.**

## Method 2 - Use Amazon AWS.

If you choose this method, you will need to sign up for an Amazon AWS account. I strongly recommend using your school E-mail address for the account.

* [Sign up for an Amazon AWS account](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signup?request_type=register)

As noted above, you must provide a valid credit card to sign up for these services, and you may find a small temporary hold (typically $1 USD) placed on your card which will be reversed within a day or so. This is standard practice to verify the validity of credit cards. 

> *Tip:**
>
> An option for limiting cloud costs might be to use a card from a service such as <Privacy.com>. Such virtual cards can be configured with spending limits and can be manually deactivated at any time. You also do not need to provide your actual credit card to the service when using such a method.

Follow *both* the [Create Your First Lambda Function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html) tutorial and the [Use Lambda with API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-apigateway-tutorial.html) tutorial. 

Take **screenshots** along the way showing all of the steps working. In particular, show your function's code, the configuration sections, and some applicable example of the functions running. **These screenshots are your submission for this assignment.**

## Method 3 - Use AWS Educate

AWS Educate is an option that **does not require you to provide any payment information**. This platform offers internal free sandboxes for you to work with to complete the training. You will have less freedom than the other two options (i.e. you can't leave your function running, etc).

Complete the [Getting Started with Serverless](https://awseducate.instructure.com/courses/905) course.

Your submission consists of **proof of completion**. AWS Educate has recently changed and I cannot find specific information on what proof you may be able to obtain, but you may consider a screenshot of your completion *including identifying information showing you are the one who completed the course* (hint: search for browser plugins that let you take full-page screenshots if necessary).

## Due Date

This assignment is due on **Sunday, November 10th** at **11:59 PM**.
